My Prompt Library

This is my collection of useful prompts organized by purpose. I use these prompts 
to learn new concepts, complete assignments, solve problems, and experiment with
AI tools responsibly and effectively.

## Explanations & Learning
1. **Simple Concept Explanation**
“Explain this concept as if I am new to it. Use plain language, avoid jargon, 
and include a simple real-world example to help me understand.”

This prompt helps me quickly grasp unfamiliar ideas without feeling overwhelmed,
especially when learning technical or abstract topics.


## Creative Tasks
2.	Creative Brainstorming Prompt
“Generate three creative ideas for this topic. Each idea should be unique, 
practical, and appropriate for a college-level assignment.”

I use this prompt when I need inspiration or a starting point but still want to
develop the final work myself.


## Information Retrieval
3.	Focused Information Lookup
“Summarize the key facts about this topic in 5–7 bullet points. Focus only on 
accurate, high-level information and avoid unnecessary detail.”

This prompt is useful when I need a quick overview or background information 
before doing deeper research.


## Problem-Solving
4.	Step-by-Step Problem Help
“Help me think through this problem step by step. Do not give me the final 
answer immediately. Ask guiding questions and explain the reasoning behind 
each step.”

I use this prompt to learn how to solve problems on my own rather than just 
receiving solutions.


## Custom Prompts I Created
5.	Learning Reflection Prompt
“After explaining this topic, ask me two reflection questions that check my understanding
and help me apply what I learned.”

This is a prompt I created to turn AI explanations into an active learning experience 
instead of passive reading.
