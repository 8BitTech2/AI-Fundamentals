### Prompt 1: Simple Explanation Task
**Prompt**: Explain what artificial intelligence is to someone who has never heard of it before. Keep it under 100 words.

| Tool    | Response Time | Quality ( /5 ) | Notes                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemini  | Fast          | 4 / 5          | Clear, concise, and accurate explanation. Stayed well within word limit but felt generic and informational rather than conversational. |
| Claude  | Medium        | 5 / 5          | Approachable and well-framed for a true beginner. Strong clarity and tone without oversimplification.                                  |
| ChatGPT | Medium        | 3 / 5          | Technically correct but more abstract. Less accessible for someone with no prior exposure to AI concepts.                              |

### Prompt 2: Creative Task
**Prompt:** Write a haiku about debugging code at 2 AM.

| Tool    | Response Time | Quality ( /5 ) | Notes                                                                              |
| ------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemini  | Fast          | 3 / 5          | Correct haiku structure but minimal imagery and emotional depth.                   |
| Claude  | Medium        | 5 / 5          | Vivid, expressive, and emotionally resonant. Strong sense of mood and persistence. |
| ChatGPT | Medium        | 4 / 5          | Solid and relevant haiku. Creative but more formulaic than Claude’s response.      |

### Prompt 3: Information Retrieval
**Prompt:** List 5 key differences between machine learning and traditional programming. Format as a comparison table.

| Tool    | Response Time | Quality ( /5 ) | Notes                                                                         |
| ------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemini  | Fast          | 5 / 5          | Excellent table structure with precise terminology and clear contrasts.       |
| Claude  | Medium        | 4 / 5          | Accurate and thoughtful but slightly more verbose than necessary for a table. |
| ChatGPT | Medium        | 4 / 5          | Correct and readable comparison, though explanations were more generic.       |

### Prompt 4: Problem-Solving
**Prompt:** Create a 30-day GitHub learning plan with daily tasks under 30 minutes.

| Tool    | Response Time | Quality ( /5 ) | Notes                                                                                  |
| ------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemini  | Fast          | 4 / 5          | Well-organized and concise. Felt checklist-driven rather than conceptually scaffolded. |
| Claude  | Medium        | 5 / 5          | Strong instructional pacing with learner-focused progression and practical emphasis.   |
| ChatGPT | Medium        | 3 / 5          | Met basic requirements but lacked intentional sequencing and conceptual reinforcement. |

## Comparative Analysis (2–3 Paragraphs)

Across all four prompts, clear strengths and trade-offs emerged between the three AI tools. Gemini 2.5 Flash consistently 
demonstrated the fastest response times and the strongest performance on structured, information-heavy tasks. Its comparison 
tables and concise explanations were precise and well-formatted, making it especially effective for rapid experimentation, 
factual retrieval, and documentation-oriented work. However, its creative output and instructional scaffolding felt mechanical,
suggesting that Gemini prioritizes efficiency and structure over expressiveness or pedagogical nuance.

Claude distinguished itself through answer quality and tone rather than speed. While responses took slightly longer to generate,
the outputs were consistently thoughtful, well-reasoned, and learner-centered. Claude performed best on the creative haiku and 
the 30-day GitHub learning plan, where clarity, pacing, and human-like reasoning mattered most. Its explanations felt intentional
rather than transactional, which makes it particularly well-suited for writing, reflection, creative tasks, and guided learning 
scenarios where understanding is prioritized over speed.

ChatGPT 3.5 functioned as a capable generalist but did not strongly outperform the other tools in any single category. Its 
responses were accurate and usable across all prompts, though often more generic and less refined. Creative outputs followed 
predictable patterns, and problem-solving responses lacked the depth seen in Claude’s work. Despite these limitations, ChatGPT 
3.5 remains a reliable baseline assistant that can support a wide range of tasks when specialized strengths are not required.

**Tool selection takeaway:** Gemini is ideal for speed and structure, Claude excels at reasoning and instructional quality, and 
ChatGPT 3.5 provides dependable all-purpose support.

## My Choice for Primary Tool
**Tool**: ChatGPT  

**Reasoning**: I selected ChatGPT as my primary tool because it provides the greatest flexibility and control over how I structure,
refine, and iteratively modify my prompts. As a paid subscriber, I value the ability to adjust inputs, revisit responses, and 
progressively shape outputs to better match academic and professional requirements. ChatGPT performs reliably across explanation,
creative, information retrieval, and problem-solving tasks, making it a versatile day-to-day assistant. While other tools may 
excel in specific areas, ChatGPT’s consistency and adaptability make it the most practical choice for sustained coursework use.  

**Backup Plan**: When I encounter rate limits or need faster, highly structured outputs, I will switch to Gemini 2.5 Flash for 
efficiency and clean formatting. For tasks that benefit from stronger narrative tone, creativity, or guided learning structure,
I will use Claude as a secondary support tool.
