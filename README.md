CSC-113: AI Fundamentals - Building practical AI tools and learning prompt engineering  -Sp 2026

#### Week 2: AI Tools & First Collaborations
**Date**: [22Jan2026]

**What I learned this week:**
This week focused on comparative use of multiple AI tools and their practical limitations. I 
observed differences in response latency, output structure, and suitability for specific task
categories such as explanation, ideation, and summarization. I also gained hands-on experience
with prompt engineering as an iterative process, learning that explicit constraints, role 
assignment, and output formatting significantly improve response accuracy. Exposure to rate 
limits highlighted the operational constraints of AI platforms and reinforced the need for 
efficient prompt design.

**What challenged me:**
A primary challenge was optimizing prompts to minimize unnecessary iterations while maximizing
informational value. Poorly scoped prompts led to inefficient use of requests, particularly 
under rate-limited conditions. Balancing experimentation with disciplined prompt construction
required more planning than initially expected.

**What I'm proud of:**
I am proud of my improved ability to structure prompts with clear objectives, constraints, 
and expected outputs. This resulted in more consistent and relevant AI responses. I also 
successfully adapted my workflow to account for rate limits by batching tasks and refining
prompts offline before submission.

**Questions I still have:**
Outstanding questions include how different models manage conversational context and token 
limits over extended sessions. I am also interested in how AI rate limiting and quota management
influence enterprise-scale deployments and development practices.
