# SAGE: My Study Assistant & Guide Engine

## What is SAGE?
     SAGE, which stands for Study Assistant & Guide Engine, is a personalized AI-powered learning companion 
designed to support students as they navigate coursework, concepts, and skill development in a structured 
and reflective way. Conceptually, SAGE functions as a guided partner rather than a shortcut, helping 
learners organize information, ask better questions, review material, and connect ideas across topics. 
Instead of simply providing answers, SAGE is intended to scaffold learning by explaining concepts in context,
offering study strategies, and reinforcing understanding through clarification and iteration. In this sense,
SAGE embodies the core philosophy of modern AI-assisted education: augmenting human learning rather than 
replacing human thinking.
     I am building SAGE as an assignment in your CTS-113 (AI Fundamentals) course because it directly aligns 
with the course’s stated learning objectives and instructional philosophy. CTS-113 emphasizes understanding
foundational AI concepts, critically using generative AI tools, and creating a practical project that makes
learning or daily work easier. SAGE satisfies all three goals simultaneously. It demonstrates my understanding 
of how AI systems can be applied to real problems, showcases my ability to use AI as a purposeful tool rather 
than a novelty, and results in a tangible artifact that improves the student learning experience. Rather than
being an abstract exercise, SAGE is a functional system with a clearly defined audience and use case.
From a pedagogical perspective, SAGE also reflects the course’s emphasis on becoming an “AI power user” instead
of a passive consumer of technology. CTS-113 encourages students to think carefully about task suitability, prompt 
design, and human-AI collaboration. By designing SAGE, I am practicing exactly that mindset: defining a narrow
and appropriate role for AI, shaping its behavior through intentional prompts, and positioning it as a study aid
that reinforces academic integrity. This mirrors the course’s AI partnership model, where AI tools are used to
explain concepts, organize thinking, and support learning without doing the intellectual work for the student.
    In my view, building SAGE is an especially strong assignment choice because it demonstrates maturity in how AI
should be integrated into education. Rather than treating AI as an answer generator, SAGE treats AI as 
infrastructure for learning, something that helps students reflect, plan, and engage more deeply with material.
That design choice shows an understanding of both the strengths and limitations of AI systems, a theme emphasized 
throughout the course readings and discussions. As an assignment, SAGE is not only compliant with CTS-113 requirements
but exemplary, because it produces a meaningful, ethical, and reusable learning tool that embodies the course’s broader
goals of critical thinking, responsible AI use, and practical application.


## How I'll Use SAGE This Semester
     I plan to use AI tools in several specific and intentional ways to support my studies while maintaining academic
integrity and personal accountability for my learning.
     First, I will use AI to help clarify difficult concepts after I have reviewed the course material. When a topic 
does not fully make sense, I will ask AI to explain it in diverse ways or provide examples so I can deepen my 
understanding rather than simply memorize information.
     Second, I will use AI to help with study planning and organization. This includes breaking large assignments 
into smaller, manageable tasks, creating study schedules, and organizing notes so I can stay on track and manage 
my time more effectively across multiple courses.
     Third, I will use AI for practice and self-assessment. I plan to generate practice questions, review prompts,
and study guides based on specific topics so I can assess my understanding, identify gaps in my knowledge, and 
focus my studying where it is most needed.
    Fourth, I will use AI as a writing support tool, not a replacement for my own work. I will write my own drafts 
and then use AI to help improve clarity, grammar, and structure, ensuring my submissions are clear, professional, 
and well organized.
    Finally, I will use AI as a learning partner for reflection and problem-solving. By talking through ideas, 
exploring different approaches to assignments, and asking guided questions, I can strengthen my critical thinking 
skills and become a more effective, independent learner.


## Tools I'm Using
Primary: ChatGPT – I chose this as my primary AI tool because it is flexible, reliable, and well suited for 
studying, writing support, concept clarification, and structured reasoning. It allows me to ask follow-up 
questions, refine explanations, and engage in iterative learning conversations, which aligns well with my 
goal of using AI as a learning partner rather than a shortcut.

Secondary: Google Gemini – I will use this as a backup tool when I want an alternative explanation, a 
second perspective on a concept, or when comparing how different AI systems respond to the same prompt. 
Using a secondary tool helps me think more critically about AI output instead of assuming one system is 
always correct.

For Special Tasks: Specialized or task-focused AI tools, for certain assignments, I may use tools designed 
for specific purposes, such as image generation for creative projects, study-aid platforms for flashcards
or quizzes, or AI-powered writing checkers for grammar and clarity. These tools will be used selectively 
when they are better suited to a particular task than a general-purpose AI.

•	Canva – Used for creating visuals, diagrams, infographics, and presentation graphics for assignments 
that require a visual or creative component.
•	DALL·E – Used for generating AI-created images when a project calls for original visuals, conceptual 
illustrations, or creative experimentation with generative AI.
•	Quizlet (AI-assisted features) – Used for creating flashcards, practice quizzes, and quick review sets
to reinforce memorization and recall before exams.
•	Grammarly – Used for grammar, clarity, and tone refinement after I have written my own drafts, ensuring
submissions are polished and professional.
•	GitHub (with AI assistance) – Used for documenting projects, reflections, and coursework artifacts, 
supporting version control, organization, and professional portfolio development.


## Ground Rules for Working with AI
I will use AI as a support tool for learning, not as a replacement for my own thinking or effort. I will 
complete readings, lectures, and initial problem-solving on my own before turning to AI for clarification,
reinforcement, or alternative explanations.

I will be transparent and responsible about my AI use. When an assignment requires original thought or 
reflection, I will ensure the ideas come from me and will only use AI for formatting, organization, or 
language refinement if permitted by the assignment instructions.

I will use AI to improve understanding, not to bypass challenges. If I am struggling with a concept or 
task, I will ask AI to guide my reasoning, explain underlying principles, or suggest study strategies 
rather than asking it to produce final answers or solutions.

I will critically evaluate AI output instead of accepting it at face value. I will verify important 
information using course materials or trusted sources and treat AI responses as suggestions that require 
judgment, not as authoritative facts.

I will always respect academic integrity and course policies. If an instructor restricts or prohibits AI 
use for a specific assignment, I will follow those guidelines and rely solely on my own work, using AI 
only when it is explicitly allowed and appropriate.
